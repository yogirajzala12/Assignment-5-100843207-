**Introduction of Assignment:**
From the given data set of youtube data, It is required to build a function that illustrates the frequency distribution of the first 1000 rows.


**Descriptions of steps:**

Importing the top 1000 records into a new df1 variable in the jupyter notebook is the first step in building a function that determines the distribution of channetype data in a given data set for the top 1000 records.

After that, Histogram function has been created, which visualises the distribution of channeltype data.

Then, used the plt.hist function to visualise the histogram frequency distribution after specifying the function name with def histogram function (). The axis should also be labelled, and the histogram should be given a name.
