Importing the top 1000 records into a new df1 variable in the jupyter notebook is the first step in building a function that determines the distribution of channetype data in a given data set for the top 1000 records.


After that, we constructed the histogram function function, which visualises the distribution of channeltype data.


We used the plt.hist function to visualise the histogram frequency distribution after specifying the function name with def histogram function (). The axis should also be labelled, and the histogram should be given a name.
